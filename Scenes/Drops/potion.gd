class_name Potion

enum PotionType { 
	AMBIGUOUS, ## No information is printed on the bottle itself. Useful for wild card potions, or for potions with nuanced, conditional, or miscellaneous effects.
	BUFFING, ## Potions that increase something. Usually used for good things. Numbers might actually be decreased with this potion, but the general effect is beneficial.
	NERFING, ## Potions that decrease something. Even if the number itself is increasing behind the scenes, if the effect is generally negative, this is the correct type.
	MODIFIER, ## A potion that is applied multiplicatively to a stat or effect. It modifies something, or adds a new effect. More information can be provided with colouring.
	SPAWNER, ## A potion that can be used to spawn a creature, or perhaps creatures. Useful for players who might want to farm or grind, or perhaps need some quick coin.
	SHIELDING ## A potion that increases the player's defenses. This one is differentiated from the rest for ease of quick readability mid-combat.
